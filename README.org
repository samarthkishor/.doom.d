#+TITLE:   Samarth's Doom Emacs Configuration

* Description

After fiddling with my own vanilla Emacs configuration for a while, I figured it's probably best to stick with the tried-and-true Doom Emacs distribution for its speed and simplicity.

This isn't in a literate org-mode format (for now) because I haven't changed enough of the settings to make it worth the hassle.

No idea if my code is idiomatic but it works (for the most part).
